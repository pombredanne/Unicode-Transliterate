Warning - This module is in ALPHA stage and will
surely be integrated in PICU (Perl wrappers for ICU)
library in the near future.

If you are in a hurry to find a Perl library that provides
decent transliteration services, you might wanna give
it a try though.

This library requires ICU 2.0 (search for 'ICU' on google)
This library is redistributed under the same license as Perl itself
